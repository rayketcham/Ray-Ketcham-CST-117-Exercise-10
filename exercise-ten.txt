Given a text file, write a program (console application) that counts 
the number of words that end with the letter ‘t’ or ‘e’ (not case-sensitive).  
We’ll say that a t’ or ‘e’ is at the end of a word if there is not an alphabetic 
letter immediately following it.  The program should output the resulting count.
